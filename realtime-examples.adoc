A good real-world example of stream processing is the kitchen
of a typical restaurant, which consists of waiters, dishwashers, prep cooks, line cooks, sous chefs, and a
main chef who collectively implement culinary applications. Waiters take orders and bring them to the
main chef, who instructs the prep cooks on the initial preparation. This may entail chopping ingredients,
making dough, preparing icing, and so on. Their product is passed on to a line cook who is dedicated to a
particular kitchen station: the fryer, the grill, and so on. Once the line cook is done, the dish goes to either
the sous chef or the main chef for the finishing touches, which may be as simple as garnishing it with herbs.
The waiter then takes the fully prepared dish to the customer. After the customer has finished their meal,

the physical plate/bowl ends up in front of the dishwasher, who does the final cleaning. Note that at any
instance in time, a number of dishes may be in various stages of the cooking pipeline, because customers
arrive and order at different times. In addition, to ensure this parallelism, a kitchen employs many prep
cooks, line cooks, and so on.
In stream-processing speak, the waiter who brings in the order is the data source. The order itself is the
record to be processed. The various cooks and chefs constitute processing operators, whereas the customer
is the application driver. There are multiple orders, which follow parallel processing streams. Such pipelines
have to deal with two major issues: random faults and stragglers. In very large kitchens with scores of cooks
and orders, the probability of an accident is very high. Furthermore, one or two cooks may be slower than
everyone else, leading to the buildup of back pressure. Conventional systems deal with faults by either
maintaining a redundant replica of each processing stream or buffering records upstream and replaying
failed ones. Both approaches double the amount of data storage across the system. In addition, neither
method has an efficient mechanism to deal with stragglers. Imagine restaurants having to cook two dishes
instead of one for each order.
